All code is original excepting some of the login code (started with a login tutorial with no other features and built up
[https://codeshack.io/secure-login-system-php-mysql/]) users table includes four users: kathysue, joebob, don, and gary. don and gary are
admin, other two are customers- navigation bar options vary depending on whether admin or customer logs in. Passwords for all users are
"password".  Interface could be redesigned using AJAX to make it a little nicer.  Also planning to add functionality to upload
images.  Please test to your heart's content but try to undo changes to database after changing if possible.
